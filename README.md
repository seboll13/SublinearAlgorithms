## My personal work on Sublinear time algorithms

### 1. Short description
This is a personal project of mine on testing various sublinear time algorithms. It seems really vague at first glance, but it will make further sense during the development.

### 2. Note
Note that it will take a while before there are actually some functional sublinear runtime algos here. Before implementing such algorithms, there is a need for a clear structure. 
Nevertheless, each commit will clearly explain what changes have been made and when actual algorithms will be implemented.

### 3. Objectives
- Setup a vector structure
- Setup a matrix structure (inherit from vector)
- Setup a tensor structure (inherit from matrix)
- Setup helper functions for each above type
- Implement test algorithms (probably in python)
- Re-implement them in C
- ... (new ideas to come)
