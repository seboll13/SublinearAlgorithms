## My personal work on Sublinear Algorithms

### 1. Short description
Personal project on testing various sublinear time algorithms (this will seem really vague at first glance, maybe it will make more sense when the project is more complete).

### 2. Note
Note that it will take a while before there are actually some functional sublinear runtime algos, before implementing such algorithms, I need to setup a clear structure. 
Nevertheless, each commit will clearly explain what changes I am making.

### 3. Plan
- Setup a vector structure
- Setup a matrix structure
- Implement test algorithms (probably in python)
- Re-implement them in C
- ... (new ideas to come)
